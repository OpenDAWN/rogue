/**
 * ADSR envelope class.
 *
 * This class implements a traditional ADSR (Attack, Decay, Sustain,
 * Release) envelope. It responds to simple keyOn and keyOff
 * messages, keeping track of its state. The \e state = ADSR::IDLE
 * before being triggered and after the envelope value reaches 0.0 in
 * the ADSR::RELEASE state. All rate, target and level settings must
 * be non-negative. All time settings must be positive.
